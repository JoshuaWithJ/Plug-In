- GENERAL -

	- YOU HAVE TWO TYPES OF EDITABLE VALUES:
		1.- Options where they have "#define APPLY_####" are meant to activate or
			deactivate options. 0 meaning deactivated, 1 meaning activated.
			
		2.- Options that have "float" at the start are meant to change the values as
			you like and wish. YOU ARE ONLY MEANT TO CHANGE VALUES / NUMBERS IN IT,
			NOT THE CHARACTERS. You can go as high as you want and as low too
			(Aka. Negative values).
			
	- LOAD AND APPLY TEXTURE MAPS:
		To apply maps / texture is easy. To load a map you need to edit the code for
		it. it looks this way:
			"#define ####_Texture "Texture Name.(File Type)";"
		EX:
			"#define Animated_Texture "GIF.gif";"
			
		You'll only edit the texture name and file type names.
		In case you want to save the textures and map in a folder the edit you'll need
		to do is this: (The folder and maps need to be in it beforehand of course)
			"#define ####_Texture "Folder Name/Texture Name.(File Type)";"
		EX:
			"#define Animated_Texture "Maps/GIF.gif";"
		And that's it.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Tone Map:

	Tone Map Helps control the overall colors and brigthness of the model.
	You have many options to try and change. Tone Map fuctions have the same
	effects as they will in a image editor. (Exposure, Saturation, Gama).
	So all values are up to you and your visual needs. For real time editing
	in MMD you can load the ToneMap controller in your project and it'll allow
	you edit the scene freely.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Light Ambient

	-	"APPLY_LIGHT_AMBIENT" at 1 it will enable the light ambient (a.k.a the light
		direction colors. At 0 it'll disable, use it as you wish.
	
	-	"APPLY_MATERIAL_AMBIENT" at it will enable the material ambient from the model
		material configuration (PMXE). at 0 it will be disabled. 
	
	-	"APPLY_MATERIAL_EMMISIVE" at it will enable the material emmisive (a.k.a the
		diffuse color) from the model material configuration (PMXE).
		at 0 it will be disabled. 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Shader Style:

	You can choose whether have a more "realistic" shader style or a Cartoon / Toon
	Shader Style. Choose whoever fullfills your needs.
	
	SHADER STYLE 0: Default. (realistic)
	SHADER STYLE 1: Toon Shader. (Cartoon)
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Shader Type:

	You can choose two shadow rendering styles, Default type (MMD's) and an edit of 
	Half Lambert for a better shadow rendering. Choose whoever fullfills your needs.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Shadow Color:

	As the name says these options affect the color of the shadow.
	-	"APPLY_SHADER_SHADOW_COLOR" at 0 will use the TOON you applied on the model on
		PMX Editor.
	-	"APPLY_SHADER_SHADOW_COLOR" at 1 will use the color you gived on the shader
		over the "Shadow_Color" option. the way it works is this way:
		
		Color Channels:	  Red/Green/Blue/Alpha
	Shadow_Color = float4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
	
	-	This way you are also able to edit the colors of the shadow without the need
		of a toon.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Shadow Affecting Specular Reflection:

	This option make the reflections be affacted by the shadow and don't render where
	the shadow is. (Helps on realistic models)
	
	Reflection Shadow Effect Intensity: This option allow you change the intensity of
	the effect.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Texture Brigthness:

	As the name says it allow you change the value of brightness in the model. Apply
	the value that you like the best. If you are using Tone Map i recommend you a
	value of "1.5+". It'll help you bring more color easily.
 
- Toon:
	-	Toon Gradient: This option allow you to change how much the gradient of the
		shadow takes over the model.
	-	Toon Smooth: This option allow you to change the smoothness of the zone where
		the toon is being rendered. Only use values up to "1.0", anything below isn't
		recommended.
	-	Toon Intensity: This allows you change the the intensity of the color on the
		model. The more value you add, the more bright, the less, the darker it gets.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Back and Front Light:
	
	This options allow you add a back and frontal point of light to the model to add
	more detail when needed. it is not recommended to use them when you are using IBLs.
	Same way as shadow color they work this way:

		Color Channels:				Red/Green/Blue/Alpha
	Back/Front_Light_Color = float4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Animated Texture

	It allows you use a gif/png/etc. texture on the model.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Normal Map

	Same setups as before, It allows you use Normal Maps or even an animated one, Again
	a gif/png/etc.
	
	You can also flip the depth of the map in case of you needing it.
	
	-	Normal Map Intensity: It allows you change the intensity of the depth on the map.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Specular Map

	Same setups as before, It allows you use a Specular Map.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Alpha Channel

	This section allows you edit the alpha channel on the texture:
	-	APPLY ALPHA: Let's you enable the alpha in the texture. (Is very recommended to
					 keep it enabled.
	-	APPLY ALPHA CLIP: It allows you control weird alpha rendering by changing the
						  Values on the "Alpha_Clip" option. Again, you can go as up
						  and low as you wish but i recommend a "0.5" value.
	

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Alpha Post Processing (Render Target)

	This option allows you to change the alpha processing into a render target, which
	allows you to have better result on materials who uses alpha for example:
	Hairs, Plastic Materials, Fur, Glass Materials, etc.

	To load the Alpha Render Target, Load the AlphaRT.x that's on the "ADD-ONS" folder.

	NOTE: YOU HAVE TO ACTIVATE THE "Alpha Post Processing" OPTION FIRST, The Render
	target will activate automatically once you load the .x accessory.

	RENDER TARGET SETUP: Go to the "ALPHA_RT" tab in MME, once there, go into the model
						 parts you want to apply this effect on, Once selected, click on
						 "Set Effect" and select the "Alpha - On.fx". After that the effect
						 will be applied. This is done so the Render Target knows what parts
						 of the model are the ones to change.
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Alpha Color Channel

	This option allows you to use a color as the alpha channel. Basic words, erase it
	and make it transparent. Alpha Color work this way:
	
	Color Channels:      Red/Green/Blue
	Alpha_Color = float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
	
	"Alpha_Color_Intensity" Allows you to change the intensity of the effect.
	
	APPLY_ALPHA_MASK_RGB_CHANNELS: This option allows you to use a R,G,B channel
	as an Alpha Mask. (Some Game engines/Maps do that)

	R_CHANNEL_ALPHA_MASK:	Enable The Red Channel of the map as the Alpha
									mask source.
	G_CHANNEL_ALPHA_MASK:	Enable The Green Channel of the map as the Alpha
									mask source.
	B_CHANNEL_ALPHA_MASK:	Enable The Blue Channel of the map as the Alpha
									mask source.
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Transparency Mask

	Immitating DIVA's thighs mesh effect it allows you have an effect of a thigh mesh
	in your model using the TRANSPARENCY MASK that diva model give you.
	
	TRANSPARENCY COLOR TYPE 0: The FX will use a pre-made skin color in the effect.
	TRANSPARENCY COLOR TYPE 1: The FX will let you make your own skin color in the
								"Transparency_Color" color option. It work this way:
								
									Color Channels:             Red/Green/Blue
									Transparency_Color = float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

	Transparency Intensity: It allows you to change how dark the effect is.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- IBL

	This feature allows you to use IBL (Image Based Lighting) on your model which it
	can be important for more accurate lighting on stages or more detailed lighting.
	
	APPLY IBL SPECULAR: This option lets you enable the specular IBL. (Not recommended
						for hair) Irradiance IBL is needed.

	APPLY IBL LIGHT DIRECTION: This option makes the IBL rotate with the light
							   direction. (It is highly recommended to use)
							   
	IBL Intensity: This option let you change the intensity of the IBL/s.
	
	IBL Shadow Intensity: This option let you change the intensity of the IBL on
						  the shadow.
						  
	IBL Brightness: This option let you change the brightness of the IBL/s.
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- IBLR Render Target
	
	This feature lets you use multiple IBLs at the same time. It has the same functions
	as the original IBL and lets you rotate them as you like with the controller:
	
	"IBL RT - Controller.pmx"
	
	Use the bone "IBL_ROT" to rotate as you like and the many morphs to change the intensity
	and the Brightness of the IBLs.
	
	Use the "Direction" morph to swap between "Directional IBL (Moves with the Light Direction)"
	to "Static IBL" which does not move and stays in the same position (Benefitial for stages).
	
	"Shadow - Controller" works for HG shadow, which lets you controll the direction of the
	shadow of said effect. Use the "Override" morph and move the "SHAD_POS" to your liking.
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Billboard
	
	This feature allows you to add a simple but useful billboard effect to a mesh/model.
	It makes the model always rotate into the camera. Is useful for 2D assets, like flares,
	plane trees, 2D assets or any model that you may want to automatically face the camera.
	
	For a proper billboard effect you'll need to set it up in PMX Editor.
	Please read this part as it is important.
	First we need a bone to move the billboard model of it's place and specify the model
	name so it is recognized by the effect:
	
	Billboard_Model_Name: Is the name of the model where the billboard bone is in.
	if you are using the effect in the same model you have the bone. leave it as is:
	
	´´ Billboard_Model_Name "(self)" ´´
	
	"(self)" means the bone (a.k.a the controller) is in the model you applied the effect on.
	If another model has the bone on it or you want to share it between 2 effects/models,
	you'll have to specify the name + the file type between the quotations. for example:
	
	´´ Billboard_Model_Name "your_model_name.pmx" ´´
	
	and that's it.
	
	Billboard_Bone_Name: Is the name of the bone that the billboard will move on.
	You can add a bone named "BILLBOARD" to your model in PMX Editor and it'll work
	automatically. If you want another bone name to move the billboard, you'll need
	to change the name that the option has between the quotations but this time without
	any file type. Example
	
		#define Billboard_Bone_Name "BILLBOARD"
		
		to:
		
		#define Billboard_Bone_Name "other_bone_name"
		
	Have in mind, the bone and the effect bone need to have the exact name. And that's it.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Blend Type

	These are options are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to be used only for experienced users.
	If you are not experienced on fxs i'll recommend you to avoid them if you don't
	someone to advice you on them.
	
	FOR PROJECT DIVA USERS!:
	You can also use MikuMikuModel to check: "Source Blend Factor" and
	"Destination Blend Factor" on the material list. this is what they
	equal on plug-in:
	
	Source Blend Factor = SRC_BLEND_TYPE
	Destination Blend Factor = DEST_BLEND_TYPE
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 - EYE VARIATION EXCLUSIVE OPTIONS -

	This option mask allows you use a texture on top to detail the eye, for example:
	Eyes Highlight.
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Specular Pos

	Specular Pos X/Y:	Inspired on DIVA, This option allows you move the secondary
						specular from it's place to add more detail to the eye.
